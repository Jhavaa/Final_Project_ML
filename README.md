# Final Project ML
Due last day of class

# Purpose
Our group aims to create a model that would be able to determine whether or not a purchase made was fraudulant. We used the [creditcard.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud "creditcard.csv") data file found on kaggle.
# Machine Learning Models

 - Logistic Regression: 
 - SVM:
 - Random Forest:

# File Descriptions

 - [credit_data.py](https://github.com/Jhavaa/Final_Project_ML/blob/master/credit_data.py
   "credit_data.py"): Loads the data and does any appropriate data
   preprocessing to make the data dependable for our model.
 - [credit_analysis.py](https://github.com/Jhavaa/Final_Project_ML/blob/master/credit_analysis.py
   "credit_analysis.py"): In depth notes and analysis on the credit card
   dataframe. Run this file to view statistical data.
 - [sbs.py](https://github.com/Jhavaa/Final_Project_ML/blob/master/sbs.py
   "sbs.py"): The python file that holds the SBS() class.
 - [feature_selection_sbs.py](https://github.com/Jhavaa/Final_Project_ML/blob/master/feature_selection_sbs.py
   "feature_selection_sbs.py"): Uses the SBS() class to perform feature
   selection. Runs this to view SBS results on our models.
 - [grid_search.py](https://github.com/Jhavaa/Final_Project_ML/blob/master/grid_search.py
   "grid_search.py"): Uses the sklearn grid search functionality that
   performs feature tuning. Run this to view grid search results on our model.
